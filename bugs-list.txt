Assignment: Lab 7

Bugs Found:
- From test1 and test8, we can infer that isEmpty() always returns true no matter what (even if the list is not empty).

- From tests 7 and 9 - 13, we can conclude that since size() works corrrectly, the bugs are that neither removeFront() nor removeBack() remove any value(s) from the list.

- From tests 14 - 17 we can infer that removeBack() and removeFront() always return true no matter what (even if the list is non-empty).
